What is an Agent?

An agent is an autonomous unit programmed to:

- Perform tasks
- Make decisions
- Communicate with other agents

Think of an agent as a member of a team, with specific skills and a particular job to do. Agents can have different roles like 'Researcher', 'Writer', or 'Customer Support', each contributing to the overall goal of the crew.
